This repository contains code from our class smart and connected systems at Boston University.
The class had five large projects, each of which is stored in its own folder. These projects were centered around using ESP32s to create interactive systems, with an emphasis on wireless connection over WiFi.

Thanks to Dr. Thomas Little for creating this class.
